Section,Question,Answer
Treatment Philosophy,What is your general surgical approach for ACL tears?,I prefer anatomical single-bundle ACL reconstruction using hamstring autografts. Precision in tunnel placement and early rehab are key.
Treatment Philosophy,"Do you delay surgery in certain cases (e.g., swelling, muscle atrophy)?","Yes, I delay surgery until acute inflammation subsides, ideally 2–3 weeks post-injury to allow quad activation and reduce stiffness risk."
Post-op Protocol,When can the patient start weight-bearing post ACL reconstruction?,Toe-touch weight-bearing with brace from Day 1. Partial weight-bearing by Week 2. Full weight-bearing by Week 4 depending on muscle control.
Post-op Protocol,When should range-of-motion exercises begin?,"ROM exercises start from Day 2, focusing on 0–90° initially. Gradual progression beyond 90° begins after 2–3 weeks."
Post-op Protocol,"Typical time for return to jogging, sports, full flexion?",Jogging typically starts at 10–12 weeks. Pivot sports at 6–8 months. Full flexion usually regained by 5–6 weeks.
Post-op Protocol,How long is a knee brace used post-op?,Knee brace is mandatory for 2–3 weeks to avoid hyperextension and graft strain during early neuromuscular control development.
Patient Education,What are the most common patient doubts or fears?,"They often ask: ‘Why is my knee clicking?’, ‘Is swelling normal?’, ‘When can I walk normally?’ or ‘Will my graft fail?’"
Patient Education,What symptoms should the patient consider normal during early recovery?,"Mild swelling, clicking, muscle twitching, and stiffness after inactivity are common. Reassure unless accompanied by warmth, redness, or severe pain."
Communication Style,Preferred tone when addressing pain or anxiety?,"Supportive, factual and calming. Patients appreciate clarity and step-by-step progress tracking."
Communication Style,"Should the bot coach the patient on lifestyle (e.g., weight, posture)?","Yes, the bot should gently reinforce posture, quad strength, nutrition and weight control especially in delayed recovery."
Rehabilitation Plan,"What exercises do you recommend at early, mid, and late phases of rehab?","Early (Week 1–2): Ankle pumps, quad sets, heel slides. Mid (Week 3–6): SLR, mini squats, step-ups. Late (Post Week 12): balance training, sport drills."
Rehabilitation Plan,Do you prefer supervised physiotherapy or is home-based acceptable?,Supervised physiotherapy is preferred initially. Home-based programs acceptable after week 4 if compliance is high and no complications arise.
Escalation Criteria,Which signs must trigger an immediate alert to you or the clinic?,"Signs like persistent fever, wound discharge, inability to lift leg, severe swelling after Day 7 should be flagged immediately."
Escalation Criteria,"What signs are ‘gray zone’ — not urgent, but require monitoring?","Swelling at end of day, tightness in morning, clicking without instability — these should be monitored and reported if worsening."
Behavioral Coaching,What are typical patient behaviors that risk recovery?,"Non-compliance with brace, skipping PT, attempting to jog early, or stopping pain meds prematurely can hinder recovery."
Behavioral Coaching,What motivates your patients best in the rehab phase?,"Setting micro-goals (e.g., 'achieve 90° flexion by Day 10'), visual progress (charts, timelines), and motivational messages help athletes and young patients."
Edge Cases & Modifications,"Do you change your approach for obese, elderly or athletes?",Yes — athletes get an accelerated but stricter program. Obese or elderly patients are moved slower with focus on stability and fall prevention.
Edge Cases & Modifications,Are there any treatments or movements you forbid in specific populations?,I avoid resisted open chain exercises in early phase. Pivoting or sudden deceleration drills are restricted until 5–6 months post-op.
Examples & Heuristics,"Can you describe a patient who recovered extremely well, and why?","One 26-year-old patient with regular PT, strict adherence, and optimistic attitude returned to competitive football in 7 months without complications."
Critical Escalation Cases,List scenarios where the bot must NOT answer and instead connect the patient with the doctor.,These scenarios are red flags and should bypass automated response:
Critical Escalation Cases,High fever (>101°F) post-surgery,Yes – could indicate infection or systemic response. Must refer immediately.
Critical Escalation Cases,Persistent wound discharge or foul smell,Yes – sign of possible wound infection or graft complication.
Critical Escalation Cases,Inability to perform straight leg raise by Day 10,Yes – potential nerve damage or failed quadriceps recovery.
Critical Escalation Cases,Severe knee swelling with pain after Day 7,"Yes – needs clinical evaluation for hemarthrosis, inflammation or graft issue."
Critical Escalation Cases,"Acute instability or re-injury during rehab (e.g., popping sound or giving way)",Yes – could mean graft failure or secondary injury. Requires imaging and surgeon input.
